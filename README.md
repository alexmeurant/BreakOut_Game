# Breakout_Game

A light version of Arkanoid with **Lua and Love2D**

This is my **first workshop in programming a video game**. I have discovered the Lua language and the Love2D engine within the [Gamecodeur.com](https://www.gamecodeur.fr) site. This workshop is based on an universal principle imagined by Atari in 1976 under the name of Breakout.

The workshop leads me to realize a basic Breakout game.

Here are the features the workshop helps to put in place:

- A racket that moves with the movements of your mouse
- A ball that is launched by clicking
- This one will then bounce on the walls, the bricks, and the racket
- When a brick is hit, it is destroyed and the ball reverses its course
