# Breakout_Game

A light version of Arkanoid with **Lua and Love2D**

This is my **first workshop in programming a video game**. I have discovered the Lua language and the Love2D engine within the [Gamecodeur.com](https://www.gamecodeur.fr) site. This workshop is based on an universal principle imagined by Atari in 1976 under the name of Breakout.

The workshop leads me to realize a basic Breakout game.

Here are the features the workshop helps to put in place:

- A racket that moves with the movements of your mouse
- A ball that is launched by clicking
- This one will then bounce on the walls, the bricks, and the racket
- When a brick is hit, it is destroyed and the ball reverses its course

**Here are the features I have added:**

- Improvement of collisions
- Acceleration of the ball when a brick is hit
- A sound effect when a brick is hit
- A background music
- Pad controlling with arrows
- Pad's position and collision improvement
- Player object added
- Score, lifes, newgame management
- Custom crystal bricks (Free Vector Graphics by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vecteezy.com/">Vecteezy.com</a>)
